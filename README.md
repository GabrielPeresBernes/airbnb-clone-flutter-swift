# 🏠 Airbnb UI Clone – Flutter vs SwiftUI

This project is a visual and structural comparison between two implementations of the same UI: one using **Flutter**, and the other using **SwiftUI**.

The goal is to explore how each framework handles common UI components, layout logic, and code organization when building a screen inspired by the Airbnb mobile app.

## 🧠 Key Differences

| Flutter | SwiftUI |
|--------|---------|
| Widget tree with nested components | Modifier-based syntax |
| More boilerplate overall | More concise and readable code |
| Large set of built-in components | Fewer built-in components |
| Highly customizable widgets | Custom UIs often built from scratch |
| UI aligns closely with native platforms | Native Apple look and feel by default |

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Flutter:** Flutter 3.32.x, Dart 3.8.x
- **Swift:** SwiftUI, Xcode 15+
